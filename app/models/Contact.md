#Contact Model#

The previous implementation of the Contact class did not involve a database, as shown in the commented section of the `contact.rb` file.

Following iterations use ActiveRecord (an object-relational mapping framework). The Contact class (model) contains the following fields:

  * first name
  * last name
  * email
  * notes

See `schema.rb` file for details.
