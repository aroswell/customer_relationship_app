#Text Formatting

The text formatting file enables the CRM application to access the bash/zsh terminal colour codes. Methods are defined in the Ruby String class; As a result the methods can be called directly on any string.

The #add_formatting method was created to perform string formatting on an array of strings - in particular, the contact info string.
